# Pascal Storage

This app is a client for the [File Browser server service](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/). This app has been tested with version [2.31.1] of the server.

## Features

These are the feature of this client available at the moment:
* login/logout with user credentials
* navigation through all folders and files of the user account.
* drag down to refresh folder if user want to force a refresh of a folder.
* download of files (1 at a time) to local disk of the device
* upload of files (1 at a time) from local disk to the remote folder in view.
* delete remote files (1 at a time).
* rename a remote file (name with or without extension).
* multi-language support** (it - en).
* offline access to local resources.
* synchronization between local - remote files.
* configurable synchronization timing (or at login).

** : additional languages could be imported. If you want to translate the app to other languages, then download this [RAW file](./lib/I18n/app_en.arb) and create a copy on your PC. Call it ```app_$language$>.arb``` where ```$language$``` will be the short representation of the language and edit all content inside. Keep all the keys the same but change the value corresponding (this file is like a JSON file so it must be edited in pretty the same way).

## Platform

This app has been developed using the Flutter Framework and therefore is available on more devices. At the moment of writing this README the app has been tested and works on these type of devices:
* Windows 11** [x64 bit]
* Android***
* Web****

**: not tested on Windows 10 or order version. You could try and see if it works.<br>
***: version 10 and 13 tested but should work with Android version 7 and up.
****: testes in Chrome 129. If you intend to use this version of this client make sure to read the [Usage](#usage) on how to install on your server.

## Usage

In order to use the app you first of all have an instance of File Browser server up and running somewhere (home lab or in the cloud) then you have to grab the version of your O.S. selecting the latest [release](https://github.com/EugenioGandini/FileBrowserFlutter/releases).
After that depending on the O.S. you have to:
* <strong>On Windows</strong>: extract the content of the compressed archive somewhere in your disk (e.g.: create a folder in ```C:\Users\<username>\pascalstorage```). Then launch the executable file that you find inside the folder (hint: you can create a Desktop shortcut to access easily the app without navigating all the time to this folder).
* <strong>On Android</strong>: copy the downloaded APK file to your device and install it using a file browser (you should grant allow app to be installed from unknown location in Android settings).
* <strong>On web client</strong>: you must download the archive of this app for the web. After that you have to serve this web static content (html, js etc...) with a file server like nginx or apache or any other server framework (Express.js or others). After that you must ensure that your File Browser server is running behind a proxy (like nginx or traefik for example) controlled by you and ensure that, on this proxy, you allow cors. This step is mandatory because if you just use the File Browser server API directly the REST API calls coming from this web app will be blocked (by the browser). This happens because (this is how cors works) they will be called from a different origin (nginx, apache or other file server origin) other than the one provided by the File Browser server (written inside the response).
I successfully test this case with traefik and after enabling the header middleware to rewrite cors out of my infrastructure, the web app, served from an nginx web server,works as exprected.
